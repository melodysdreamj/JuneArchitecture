# Create Page



1. Look at the pages in the following path(`lib/app/_/_/interaction/view.blueprint/page/_/_new`) and copy the appropriate folder.&#x20;
2. After copying the folder, move it to the following location(`lib/app/_/_/interaction/view/_/_/`) and paste it there. Rename the pasted folder to `[page_name]`
3. After selecting the page's folder in the navigation bar, open the path search & replace (Shift+Command+R on Mac) and replace 'New' with your chosen page name in camel case.(ex. PageName)
4. Replace all SafeArea widgets with your desired UI elements to create the interface you want.
