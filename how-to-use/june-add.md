# June Add

Once you find what you need on [ModuleHub](https://module.juneflow.org/) or [ViewHub](https://view.juneflow.org/), all you have to do is add it as follows.

```
june add [name]
```

### Note

*   When you use "june add," it reinstalls the package even if it's already installed (essentially upgrading the version), but it leaves any files that have already been added as they are.
