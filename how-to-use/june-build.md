# June Build

When you enter "june build," the system automatically finds all the modules and performs the appropriate actions. This includes adding code blocks, adding asset paths, adding assets, and cleaning up the initialization system.

* If you want to use a specific version of a module, just adjust to that version in pubspec.yaml and then enter "june build."\
