# Share Your View

Since JuneFlutter shares the same architecture, developers can easily share the views they've created, such as pages, components, bottom sheets, dialogs, snack bars, etc. Here, we'll delve into the specific methods of sharing.



1. First, please go to the [following GitHub repository](https://github.com/melodysdreamj/JuneFlutter) and fork it. (Remember, you're forking, not creating a template.)
2. In the forked project, please paste the view you created under `lib/blueprint/view/_/interaction/view`. Be sure to carefully place it according to its type.
3. Please give the view an appropriate name, typically by incrementing one number higher than the previous one, like 1, 2, 3, etc. Also, for the sake of reusability, set the view class names to 'New' by default.
4. If the package or other codes are linked to the existing app, please appropriately disconnect them so that they can function independently (it should work if either `usage.dart` or `usage_view.dart` is executed).
5. open the view (page, component, etc.) you want to share on an Android/iPhone, and then take a screenshot. In the video above, you can learn how to take screenshots on Android/iOS.
6. To create a link for the screenshot you made, you typically generate an image link through GitHub issues. You can find out how to create the link in the video above. After creating the link, please delete the issue.
7. Please input the screenshot link at the bottom of the `# screenshot url` section. Delete any text that was previously entered in that section.
8. In the `# contributors` section, please write your GitHub ID. If it's a modification of the view, add your ID after the existing one, separated by a comma. Delete any text that was previously entered in that section.
9. If there's anything to describe about the view, please fill it in the `# description` section. If not, leave it blank. Delete any text that was previously entered in that section.
10. In the `# tag` section, you can put anything you want. It's also searchable by tags.
11. After committing your code on Git, please push it to the forked project.
12. After pushing the view to your forked project, go to the GitHub page of the forked project and create a pull request. The target should be the original [JuneFlutter GitHub repository](https://github.com/melodysdreamj/JuneFlutter).
13. Once your pull request is accepted, the page you shared will appear on the [JuneFlutter-Views page](https://juneflutter-views.junes-architecture.lol/) after a certain period of time.
