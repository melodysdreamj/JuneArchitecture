# Page Folder Location

You can operate the page folders separately, or group certain pages together if they always follow the same scenario.

1. Operating page folders separately: You can manage them individually, such as page 1, page 2, etc.
2. Operating pages in the same folder: If GetUserName and GetNickName move together, you can put them in the same folder.
