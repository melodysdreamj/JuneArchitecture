# Toast

A toast is a small view that briefly appears at a desired location, such as the top or bottom. It is composed of [`Components`](../componenet/), and you can create it as desired.

## Create Bottom Sheet

1. Look at the pages in the following path(`lib/app/_/_/interaction/view/popup/toast/toast._`) and copy the appropriate folder.&#x20;
2. After copying the folder, move it to the following location(`lib/app/_/_/interaction/view/_/_`) and paste it there. Rename the pasted folder to `toast.[name]`
3. After selecting the toast's folder in the navigation bar, open the path search & replace (Shift+Command+R on Mac) and replace 'New' with your chosen page name in camel case.(ex. HelloWorld)
4. Replace all widgets with your desired UI elements to create the interface you want.



## How to Use

* In Android Studio, go to the code tab in usage.dart, right-click, and then click "Run 'usage.dart'".
* In another place (for example, where a toast should appear when a button is clicked), go to the appropriate location and paste the code for the 00 button from usage.dart.
