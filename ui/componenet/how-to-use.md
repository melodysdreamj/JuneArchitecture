# How to Use

Components are used to summon specific parts of a page. For example, let's assume there is a button component, and there's a scenario where this button component is called onto a page.

1. First, create page 1 and the button component.
2. Make the button component into a button.
3. Insert that button into page 1.
4. The component can be placed inside page 1, or if it's used throughout the app, it can be created separately.
